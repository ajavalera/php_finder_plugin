PHP Finder Vim Plugin
=======================
``By, <ajavalera@gmail.com>``

What is this?
------------------
This is a Vim plugin, [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) compatible, written in Python 3, that aims to add the following functionality to your most absolute coolest VIM text editor:

- Find and display sorted PHP methods `(currently working)`
- Find and open PHP classes `(In progress)`
- Manage Namespaces
- Find usage of PHP code across current files and whole project
- Other things that I haven't thought of yet...

Maturity
--------------
Please read the VERSION file.  It (tries) to follow a semantic versioning system:

```
0.0.1
| | |_Bug fix
| |_Minor release (Adding functionality, backwards compatible)
|_Mayor release (No backwards compatibility warranteed)
```

If the mayor release is 0 it means (at least as I understand it, please correct me if I'm wrong) that it's still in development.

Todo
-------------
- Make the plugin autoloadable.
- Add usage documentation
- Add examples
- Add VIM documentation
- Get my life together (no start date available)
